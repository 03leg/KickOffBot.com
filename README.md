👋 Hello! Welcome to this mono repository! 🎉

Here, you'll find a visual editor that allows you to design your own bot, along with an interpreter that executes the bot you've designed.  
Currently, we're taking small bites out of the elephant 🐘, and we only support Telegram. However, we're not planning to stop there; we're aiming to add the ability to create bots for Messenger, Instagram, Web, and WhatsApp.

## Features

- **Message Management:** Seamlessly send, edit, and delete messages with various formatting options such as bold, italic, and underline text. Attachments and inline buttons enhance communication capabilities.
- **User Message Reception and Storage:** Receive messages from users and store them in variables, enabling future interactions. These variables serve as valuable data points throughout the conversation, enhancing user engagement and facilitating personalized responses.
- **Real-time Variable Modification:** Change variables dynamically during runtime to adapt to evolving user needs and preferences. This flexibility ensures that the system remains responsive and can adjust to changing circumstances on the fly.
- **Variable-based Interaction Paths:** Our system intelligently selects the next steps of interaction based on variable values. This adaptive approach allows for personalized and optimized user journeys, ensuring that each interaction is tailored to the individual user's context and requirements.
